## License

Myriade is licensed under the [FAIR](https://fair.io) License.

In a nutshell:

- **Free to tinker**: read the code, run it anywhere, fork it, and submit PRs.
- **Free to use in-house**: self-host Myriade for internal or personal projects with no strings attached.
- **But no commercial free-riding**: for the first 24 months after each release you must not offer Myriade (or a derivative) as a service that competes with the official product.
- **Automatic open-source switch**: exactly two years after a version ships, its licence flips to Apache-2.0, giving you full open-source freedomsâ€”including commercial SaaS.
