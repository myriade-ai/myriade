## 🌟 New: Review Apps with Fly.io

Myriade now supports automatic preview environments for every pull request! Each PR gets its own isolated environment deployed to Fly.io, making it easy to test changes before merging.

## 💡 Why Myriade?

Business data lives in tables.
Insights live in your head.
**Everything in between is slow.**

Traditional BI tools force you to:

- Dig through table names.
- Guess joins.
- Write and debug SQL.
- Re-run, re-fix, re-interpret.

**Myriade kills that friction.**
Ask your question in plain English → Myriade **explores**, **writes SQL**, **fixes it**, **analyses the result**, and gives you the answer **in seconds**.

### What we value

- **Simplicity** – No setup. No training. Just ask.
- **Speed** – Answers 10× faster than manual SQL.
- **Value creation** – Clear insights so you can focus on what matters.

---

## ✨ What Myriade Does

- **Ask Anything** – “Why did sales drop on March 10?” → you get causes, not just numbers.
- **Analyze Beyond SQL** – anomaly detection, KPI gap analysis, opportunity spotting.
- **Stay in Control** – inspect and edit every query that the AI generated.
- **Plug & Play** – Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery & more.

---

## 🔒 Secure by Design

- **Read-only** – zero chance of accidental data changes.
- **Limited result previews** – AI sees only samples/stats, never full dumps.
- **Zero-Knowledge Protection** _(beta)_ – encrypt sensitive data before the AI sees it.
- **Self-host or Cloud** – your choice.

---

## 🖼 How It Works

1. **Ask** → “Create a view of `user_id`, `total_sales`, `last_product_bought`”
2. **AI explores** → finds the right tables, joins, and filters. explore and iterate.
3. **Answer delivered** → instant insight, exportable.
4. **Inspect** → view what the AI did, edit, and run it.

## 💬 Examples

| You Ask…                                         | Myriade Delivers…                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| _“Why did signups drop last week?”_              | Detects change, runs cohort diffs, surfaces likely causes. |
| _“What KPIs are missing from the store report?”_ | Reviews schema, suggests relevant new metrics.             |
| _“Show total revenue by region, last 90 days”_   | Writes & runs SQL, charts the result.                      |
